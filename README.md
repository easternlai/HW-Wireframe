###Discovered Issues

I was unable to find a way to center the child objects of Section and Article so I resorted to positioning to get the spacing I wanted.  

For example,

```
.article {
    background-color: #777;
    height: 200px;
    width: 450px;
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 10px;
    right: 10px;
}

```
